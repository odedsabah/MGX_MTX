ERP118881,ERP118881,PRJEB35769,Gut microbiome response to a fermented milk product in healthy subjects,"Although many clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotics, there are limited studies that assessed the dose-response effects of probiotics on microbiota and host. In this context, a novel multi-strain fermented dairy product was developed (Test product), combining yogurt strains (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and three candidate probiotic strains, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CNCM I-1518 and CNCM I-3689 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 selected for their effects on gut barrier function and/or gut microbiota or immunity in various models. In the present study, we conducted a 4-week intervention, randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to assess the tolerance of daily ingestion of one or three doses of the Test product in 96 healthy adults. We explored the structural and functional response of gut microbiota to intervention, and following discontinuation. Using shotgun metagenomic, we explored the KEGG orthologs that were carried by 3 probiotic candidate strains and their co-variation interactions with gut microbial species through metabolic sharing.",Tolerance study,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP118881&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","ERR3764800-ERR3764906,ERR3765039-ERR3765387",ERA2316646,"ERS4182283-ERS4182389,ERS4187653-ERS4188001","ERX3766553-ERX3766659,ERX3766792-ERX3767140","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP118881&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2019-12-11,3792117992,984161147894,2020-09-27
SRP040956,SRP040956,PRJNA243036,Choice of method for purification of bacterial DNA from faecal material influences community structure as detected by next generation sequencing,"In this study we conducted a systematic comparison of the DNA extraction methods on feacal samples used by the two major collaborative efforts: The European MetaHIT and the American Human Microbiome Project. Additionally, effects of homogenizing the samples before extraction were addressed. We observed significant differences in distribution of bacterial taxa depending on the method. While eukaryotic DNA was most efficiently extracted by the MetaHIT protocol, DNA from bacteria within the Bacteroidetes phylum was most efficiently extracted by the HMP protocol. Whereas it is comforting that the inter-individual variation clearly exceeded the variation resulting from choice of extraction method, our data highlights the challenge of comparing data across studies applying different methodologies.",gut metagenome,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP040956&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","SRR1237931-SRR1237934,SRR1238129-SRR1238136,SRR1238138-SRR1238142,SRR1238144-SRR1238150,SRR1238165-SRR1238168,SRR1238388-SRR1238395,SRR1238398-SRR1238409",SRA156375,"SRS589044,SRS591752-SRS591753,SRS591931-SRS591933,SRS591936-SRS591941,SRS591960-SRS591961,SRS591980-SRS591983,SRS591985-SRS591986,SRS591988-SRS591991","SRX510934,SRX516663,SRX516666,SRX516898-SRX516900,SRX516903,SRX516905-SRX516907,SRX516910-SRX516911,SRX516930-SRX516931,SRX517151-SRX517154,SRX517156-SRX517161","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP040956&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2017-04-21,1678679420,167867942000,2014-05-01

ERP110064,ERP110064,PRJEB27928,Meta-analysis of fecal metagenomes reveals global microbial signatures that are specific for colorectal cancer.,"Association studies have linked microbiome alterations with many human diseases. However, they have not always reported consistent results, thereby necessitating cross-study comparisons. Here, a meta-analysis of eight geographically and technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 768), which was controlled for several confounders, identified a core set of 29 species significantly enriched in CRC metagenomes (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1 × 10-5). CRC signatures derived from single studies maintained their accuracy in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved detection accuracy and disease specificity for CRC. Functional analysis of CRC metagenomes revealed enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes and depleted carbohydrate degradation genes. Moreover, we inferred elevated production of secondary bile acids from CRC metagenomes, suggesting a metabolic link between cancer-associated gut microbes and a fat- and meat-rich diet. Through extensive validations, this meta-analysis firmly establishes globally generalizable, predictive taxonomic and functional microbiome CRC signatures as a basis for future diagnostics.",NA,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP110064&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR2726404-ERR2726663,ERA1551933,ERS2637787-ERS2637868,ERX2739776-ERX2740035,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP110064&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2019-04-05,1907822296,407049497738,2018-08-14

SRP162433,SRP162433,PRJNA492714,Impact of High altitude environment of Human oral and gut microbiota,"The human oral &amp; gut microbiota continues to change phenotype by many factors (e.g. environment, host's diet, stress etc.), throughout life with a major impact on human physiology, psychology, metabolism and immune system. Amongst one such is, extreme environmental condition like High Altitude (HA) - very unique, difficult and full of health risk. Visiting population such as mountaineers, bikers, visitors, pilgrims, soldiers and special task forces who reaches High Altitude are at higher risks than at low landers. However, the reason how the extreme environment, stress, oxygen saturation and diet alter the oral &amp; gut microbiota and affect its composition remains unclear. In this study we investigated the influence of High Altitude and stay at different heights, on the health of Indian population by using metagenomic approach to determine the variation in the gut microbiota. Fecal samples were collected from individuals, at four different time points viz. before the start of the ascending, after reaching 13000ft, descending at 11000ft and at the 16000ft –19000ft. Samples were analysed for whole genome sequencing. The oral &amp; gut microbial diversity of members was significantly altered with the abundance of several bacteria, during the days of staying at 13000ft, 11000ft and 16000ft –19000ft. The oral &amp; gut microbiota comprised mainly of the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes Euryachaeota, Actinobacteria and Unclassified at three time points. Further, the differential analysis of microbes across all the phyla and genus at all the four time points. Most of the identified microbial sequences were unclassified microbiota. Evidently, some metabolic pathways like amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were also altered.",NA,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP162433&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",SRR7894898-SRR7894940,SRA782567,SRS3814598-SRS3814640,SRX4732401-SRX4732443,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP162433&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2018-09-25,506323777,98581128720,2018-09-25
SRP001634,SRP001634,PRJNA63661,Microbial composition of samples from infant gut,"The microbial composition of the gut likely contributes to a wide-range of health and disease states including intestinal inflammation, atopic disease, and possibly diseases of adulthood, such as heart disease and obesity. The early establishment of the gut microflora is suspected to have a particularly profound impact protecting the gut from infectious disease and on long-term subsequent health by predisposing individuals to atopic or autoimmune disease later in life. In contrast to the large-scale efforts of the Human Microbiome Project to characterize the microbial flora of healthy adults, relatively little has been accomplished to characterize the early establishment of the microbiota in infants.  The administration of antibiotics to infants has the capacity to profoundly affect the early acquisition, establishment, and natural maturation of commensal microflora. Prematurity is another major factor that is thought to influence 'normal' gut microbial composition in early life. A high number of pre-term infants receive antibiotic therapy prophylactically; the immediate and long-term effects of antibiotic treatment on infant and later health outcomes are unknown. We hypothesize that gestational age influences the ability to support 'normal' gut microbiota, and that antibiotic administration in the first few weeks of life can alter or delay the development of a 'normal' microbiota and may lead to adverse health outcomes. If we hope to promote the healthy establishment of early gut colonization and thereby improve health outcomes, we need to establish what 'normal' colonization looks like across gestational ages and apply this knowledge as a benchmark to understand the impact of antibiotic treatment in early postnatal life.  In this project, we propose to examine the microbiome in four cohorts ranging from extremely preterm to term, with birth weights appropriate for gestational age: Group 1) 23 to 27 weeks and extremely low birth weight [ELBW, <1000 grams]; Group 2) 28 to 32 weeks and very low birth weight [VLBW, >1000 to <1500 grams]; Group 3) 33 to 36 weeks and low birth weight [LBW, >1500 to <2500 grams]; and Group 4) term (37 to 42 weeks) and normal [>2500 to <4000 gram] birth weight.

ERP124836,ERP124836,PRJEB41102,"Analysis of human fecal metagenomes from adults and infants, to investigate strain persistance, dispersal and purifying selection of bacterial strains.","Some gut bacteria remain associated with their human host for years while others are rapidly displaced. To understand strain persistence and dispersal, we analysed gut bacteria from longitudinally-collected adult and infant faecal samples; from 5,278 metagenomes we constructed 130,862 strain-resolved metagenomic species (sMGS), representing the 440 most prevalent gut commensals. Universally there was high strain persistence (mean annual survival rate: 95%). Bacterial persistence was greater in adults than infants, and strongly correlated to the colonisation of proximal hosts. Occasionally persistence was associated  to even wider geographic neighbourhoods, typically at a regional scale (< 150 km radius). While vertical (parent-child) and horizontal (parent-parent) strain sharing was common among all phyla, highly persistent taxa were preferentially vertically shared. Bifidobacterium, Methanobrevibacter and Sutterella had the strongest family associations. Sporulation capacity and oxidative tolerance were negatively correlated with persistence, although the ability to sporulate increased family colonisation rate. Strain persistence correlated with fewer genetic bottlenecks and higher rates of purifying selection, indicating a decreased mutational burden.This data suggests that Firmicutes, often sporulation competent, have the most dynamic strain exchange and loss pattern, with less geographic restrictions, while Bacteroidota, like Prevotella and Bacteroides, have a key role in the gut colonization, as they are characterized by restricted dispersal, high family sharing and vertical transmission, and a higher resilience to strain exchanges during life and especially in the infant microbiome. We define here such species as “tenacious” commensals, which possess all the hallmarks of highly adapted species.",Persistence and dispersal strategies shape gut microbial strain evolution.,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP124836&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR4794102-ERR4794908,ERA3046547,ERS5275624-ERS5275909,ERX4663876-ERX4664682,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP124836&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2020-11-04,19732619910,2284066597552,2020-11-04

This study used metagenomic methods (community genomic analysis and sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes) to document microbial colonization of the gut of a premature infant born at 28 weeks gestation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences collected approximately daily revealed three compositional phases during colonization. We reconstructed genomes of the dominant organisms and intensively curated population genomic datasets from the third phase. In the third phase, the communities were dominated by a nearly clonal Serratia population, two Citrobacter strains sharing >99% nucleotide identity, and contained a lower abundance Enterococcus population, multiple plasmids and bacteriophage. The relative abundance of the Citrobacter strains changed significantly over time. Modeling of Citrobacter strain abundances suggests differences in growth rates and/or host colonization patterns. We identified genotypic variation potentially responsible for divergent strain ecologies, including hotspots of sequence variation in regulatory genes and intergenic regions, and in genes involved in transport, flagellar biosynthesis, substrate metabolism, and host colonization, as well as differences in the complements of these genes.

SRP103706,SRP103706,PRJNA382746,Benchmarking datasets for microbiome profiling,"Sequencing-based microbiome profiling aims at detecting and quantifying individual members of a complex microbial community in a culture-independent manner. Due to its low cost, amplicon-based sequencing (ABS) of bacterial or fungal ribosomal DNA is the most widely used technology for this purpose, however results suffer from PCR biases. Shotgun metagenomics (SMG), conversely, allows unbiased interrogation of a microbial community but requires high sequencing depth.

Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles.

We found a considerable divergence between genetic potential and functional activity of the human healthy gut microbiota, in spite of a quite comparable taxonomic structure revealed by the two approaches. Investigation of inter-individual variability of taxonomic features revealed Bacteroides and Akkermansia as remarkably conserved and variable in abundance within the population, respectively. Firmicutes-driven butyrogenesis (mainly due to Faecalibacterium spp.) was shown to be the functional activity with the higher expression rate and the lower inter-individual variability in the study cohort, highlighting the key importance of the biosynthesis of this microbial by-product for the gut homeostasis. The taxon-specific contribution to functional activities and metabolic tasks was also examined, giving insights into the peculiar role of several gut microbiota members in carbohydrate metabolism (including polysaccharide degradation, glycan transport, glycolysis and short-chain fatty acid production).

However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little to no antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with environment and lifestyle, and how complexity from the exogenous environment is matched by endogenous homeostasis.

We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance.

Results: Samples from 103 patients were included. After open-label rifaximin treatment for 2 weeks, 11 taxa (eg, Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae) had significantly lower relative abundance at a 10% false discovery rate threshold. The effects of rifaximin were generally short-term, as there were few significantly different changes in taxa relative abundance at the end of the study (up to 46 weeks) versus baseline. The state of the microbial community at baseline had modest but statistically significant power to predict which patients responded to rifaximin treatment (p=0.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that rifaximin has a modest, largely transient effect across a broad range of stool microbes. Future research may determine whether the taxa affected by rifaximin are causally linked to IBS-D.",Human gut fecal,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP110990&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","SRR5799796-SRR5799987,SRR5800002-SRR5800309,SRR5800311-SRR5800485",SRA583444,SRS2333155,"SRX2979263-SRX2979454,SRX2979469-SRX2979776,SRX2979778-SRX2979952","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP110990&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2017-07-05,2309172633,662219024724,2017-07-05

ERP120556,ERP120556,PRJEB37249,Statin therapy is associated with lower prevalence of gut microbiota dysbiosis,"Microbiome community typing analyses have recently identified the Bacteroides2 (Bact2) enterotype, an intestinal microbiota configuration that is associated with systemic inflammation and has a high prevalence in loose stools in humans. Bact2 is characterized by a high proportion of Bacteroides, a low proportion of Faecalibacterium and low microbial cell densities, and its prevalence varies from 13% in a general population cohort to as high as 78% in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reported changes in stool consistency and inflammation status during the progression towards obesity and metabolic comorbidities led us to propose that these developments might similarly correlate with an increased prevalence of the potentially dysbiotic Bact2 enterotype. Here, by exploring obesity-associated microbiota alterations in the quantitative faecal metagenomes of the cross-sectional MetaCardis Body Mass Index Spectrum cohort (n = 888), we identify statin therapy as a key covariate of microbiome diversification. By focusing on a subcohort of participants that are not medicated with statins, we find that the prevalence of Bact2 correlates with body mass index, increasing from 3.90% in lean or overweight participants to 17.73% in obese participants. Systemic inflammation levels in Bact2-enterotyped individuals are higher than predicted on the basis of their obesity status, indicative of Bact2 as a dysbiotic microbiome constellation. We also observe that obesity-associated microbiota dysbiosis is negatively associated with statin treatment, resulting in a lower Bact2 prevalence of 5.88% in statin-medicated obese participants. This finding is validated in both the accompanying MetaCardis cardiovascular disease dataset (n = 282) and the independent Flemish Gut Flora Project population cohort (n = 2,345). The potential benefits of statins in this context will require further evaluation in a prospective clinical trial to ascertain whether the effect is reproducible in a randomized population and before considering their application as microbiota-modulating therapeutics.",metacardis-statin,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP120556&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR4086424-ERR4091537,ERA2408683,ERS4538508-ERS4539395,ERX4082249-ERX4087362,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP120556&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2020-05-05,19567645518,2759823993107,2020-05-01
SRP069019,SRP069019,PRJNA301903,Metagenomic sequencing of preterm infant gut microbiota raw sequence reads,"Dysbiotic colonization of the preterm infant gut microbiota may have lifelong effects on host health. The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants' gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",NA,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP069019&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",SRR3131385-SRR3132490,SRA342712,"SRS1267685-SRS1268104,SRS1268349-SRS1268350",SRX1551029-SRX1552134,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP069019&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2020-04-14,1742053045,423953993122,2016-02-19

Each [DP5] method was assessed using six replicate faecal samples from five participants, totalling 180 samples. We further evaluated 240 samples across ten participants with the FLOQSwab-ADT to determine community stability after storage at -20ᵒC, RT, and 50ᵒC for four weeks compared to fresh controls. All samples were sequenced using shotgun metagenomics and gut microbiome profiles were assessed for technical and compositional (species and functional) reproducibility. Results FLOQSwab-ADT had the best combined performance followed by RNAlater and OMNIgene-GUT. LifeGuard and the BBL swab had unpredictable outgrowth of Escherichia species in at least one replicate from each participant. Additionally, FLOQSwab-ADT accurately preserved species and functional profiles at all temperatures tested relative to fresh controls.

As recent studies have suggested diversity in the human gut microbiome among human populations, it will be interesting to analyse how gut microbiome is correlated with geographical, cultural, and traditional differences. The Japanese people are known to have several characteristic features such as eating a variety of traditional foods and exhibit- ing a low BMI and long life span. In this study, we analysed gut microbiomes of the Japanese by com- paring the metagenomic data obtained from 106 Japanese individuals with those from 11 other nations. We found that the composition of the Japanese gut microbiome showed more abundant in the phylum Actinobacteria, in particular in the genus Bifidobacterium, than other nations. Regard- ing the microbial functions, those of carbohydrate metabolism were overrepresented with a concur- rent decrease in those for replication and repair, and cell motility. The remarkable low prevalence of genes for methanogenesis with a significant depletion of the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii and en- richment of acetogenesis genes in the Japanese gut microbiome compared with others suggested a difference in the hydrogen metabolism pathway in the gut between them. It thus seems that the gut microbiome of the Japanese is considerably different from those of other populations, which cannot be simply explained by diet alone.

SRP027547,SRP027547,PRJNA212536,"Effects of Diet on Resource Utilization by a Model Human Gut Microbiota Containing Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, a Symbiont with an Extensive Glycobiome (RNA-Seq)","The human gut microbiota is an important metabolic organ, yet little is known about how its individual species interact, establish dominant positions, and respond to changes in environmental factors such as diet. In this study, gnotobiotic mice were colonized with an artificial microbiota comprising 12 sequenced human gut bacterial species and fed oscillating diets of disparate composition. Rapid, reproducible, and reversible changes in the structure of this assemblage were observed. Time-series microbial RNA-Seq analyses revealed staggered functional responses to diet shifts throughout the assemblage that were heavily focused on carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. High-resolution shotgun metaproteomics confirmed many of these responses at a protein level. One member, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, proved exceptionally fit regardless of diet. Its genome encoded more carbohydrate active enzymes than any previously sequenced member of the Bacteroidetes. Transcriptional profiling indicated that B. cellulosilyticus WH2 is an adaptive forager that tailors its versatile carbohydrate utilization strategy to available dietary polysaccharides, with a strong emphasis on plant-derived xylans abundant in dietary staples like cereal grains. Two highly expressed, diet-specific polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in B. cellulosilyticus WH2 were identified, one with characteristics of xylan utilization systems. Introduction of a B. cellulosilyticus WH2 library comprising >90,000 isogenic transposon mutants into gnotobiotic mice, along with the other artificial community members, confirmed that these loci represent critical diet-specific fitness determinants. Carbohydrates that trigger dramatic increases in expression of these two loci and many of the organism's 111 other predicted PULs were identified by RNA-Seq during in vitro growth on 31 distinct carbohydrate substrates, allowing us to better interpret in vivo RNA-Seq and proteomics data. These results offer insight into how gut microbes adapt to dietary perturbations at both a community level and from the perspective of a well-adapted symbiont with exceptional saccharolytic capabilities, and illustrate the value of artificial communities. Overall design: 116 samples total. In 26 of these samples, we evaluated community-wide gene expression using RNA isolated from the feces of a gnotobiotic mouse harboring an artificial community comprised of 12 human gut microbes.

However, no mechanisms are known to cross-regulate prokaryotic and eukaryotic circadian rhythms in multi-kingdom ecosystems. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota, in both mice and humans, exhibits diurnal oscillations that are influenced by feeding rhythms, leading to time-specific compositional and functional profiles over the course of a day. Ablation of host molecular clock components or induction of jet lag leads to aberrant microbiota diurnal fluctuations and dysbiosis, driven by impaired feeding rhythmicity. Consequently, jet lag-induced dysbiosis in both mice and humans promotes glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferrable to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of coordinated meta-organism diurnal rhythmicity, and offer a microbiome-dependent mechanism for common metabolic disturbances in humans with aberrant circadian rhythms, such as those documented in shift workers and frequent flyers.",Trans-kingdom control of microbiota diurnal oscillations promotes metabolic homeostasis,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP006800&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","ERR588671,ERR588673-ERR588697,ERR588708-ERR588735,ERR658090-ERR658095",ERA352797,"ERS534784,ERS534786-ERS534810,ERS534821-ERS534848,ERS569457-ERS569462","ERX546675,ERX546677-ERX546701,ERX546712-ERX546739,ERX614411-ERX614416","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP006800&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2014-10-01,659922874,58372106303,2014-10-17

Since this makes comparisons between studies difficult, we aimed at defining an easy, low-cost, and reproducible methodology for each of these three steps. We analysed five different techniques to isolate phages from human adult faeces and developed a pipeline to analyse their genomes in order to quantify contamination and classify phage contigs in terms of taxonomy and lifestyle. Among the five techniques, we chose the polyethylene glycol concentration method to isolate phages because of its simplicity, low cost, reproducibility, and high number and diversity of phage sequences. We also tested the reproducibility of this method with multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and showed that MDA severely decreases the phage genetic diversity of the samples and the reproducibility of the method. Lastly, we studied the influence of depth sequencing on phage diversity and observed the beginning of a plateau for phage contigs at 20,000,000 reads.

However, it is not yet known when in early development our microbiota community structure and function is initially established and diversifies. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007).

We reconstructed 591 ancient bacterial genomes, 52% of which are novel species. This is the first large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from ancient microbiome samples. Functional profiling of the coprolites revealed significantly fewer antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors, and altered carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions relative to the modern, industrial gut microbiome.

Our findings support the importance of microbial carbohydrate metabolism during early infancy in protecting against development of allergies and suggest metabolite therapy as a potential prevention strategy.","The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study is a multicenter longitudinal, prospective, general population birth cohort study.

The recent success of metagenomics has created a demand to rapidly apply the technology to large case-control cohort studies and to studies of microbiota from various habitats, including habitats relatively poor in microbes. It is therefore of foremost importance to enable a robust and rapid quality assessment of metagenomic data from samples that challenge present technological limits (sample numbers and size). Here we demonstrate that the distribution of overlapping k-mers of metagenome sequence data predicts sequence quality as defined by gene distribution and efficiency of sequence mapping to a reference gene catalogue. We used serial dilutions of gut microbiota metagenomic datasets to generate well defined high to low quality metagenomes. We also analysed a collection of 52 microbiota derived metagenomes. We demonstrate that k-mer distributions of metagenomic sequence data identify sequence contaminations, such as sequences derived from “empty” ligation products. Of note, k-mer distributions were also able to predict the frequency of sequences mapping to a reference gene catalogue not only for the well-defined serial dilution datasets, but also for 52 human gut microbiota derived metagenomic datasets. We propose that k-mer analysis of raw metagenome sequence reads should be implemented as a first quality assessment prior to more extensive bioinformatical analysis, such as sequence filtering and gene mapping. With the rising demand for metagenomic analysis of microbiota it is crucial to provide tools for rapid and efficient decision making. This will eventually lead to a faster turn-around time, improved analytical quality including sample quality metrics and a significant cost reduction.

Bariatric surgery is an effective therapeutic procedure for morbidly obese patients. The two most common interventions are Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB).

Objectives
The aim of this study was to compare microbiome long-term microbiome after SG and LRYGB surgery in obese patients.Methods89 and 108 patients who underwent SG and LRYGB respectively, were recruited. Stools were collected before and 6 months after surgery. Microbial DNA was analysed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SOLiD 5500xl Wildfire). MSPminer, a novel innovative tool to characterize new in silico biological entities, was used to identify 715 Metagenomic Species Pan-genome (MSPs). 148 functional modules were analysed using GOmixer and KEGG database.

Result
Both interventions resulted in a similar increase of Shannon’s diversity index and gene richness of gut microbiota, in parallel with weight loss, but the changes of microbial composition were different. LRYGB led to higher relative abundance of aero-tolerant bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and buccal species, such as Streptococcus and Veillonella spp. In contrast, anaerobes such as Clostridium were more abundant after SG, suggesting better conservation of anaerobic conditions in the gut. Enrichement of Akkermansia muciniphila was also observed after both surgeries. Function-level changes included higher potential for bacterial use of supplements such as vitamin B12, B1 and iron upon LRYGB.

Conclusion
Microbiota changes after bariatric surgery depend on the nature of the intervention. LRYGB induces greater taxonomic and functional changes in gut microbiota than SG and may lead to a more dysbiotic microbiome.

Consequences of a MD intervention on the overall metabolic and microbiome responses in subjects at risk of metabolic diseases are still underinvestigated. We aimed at unvealing the effects of a personalized isocaloric MD intervention in overweight and obese subjects with unhealthy dietary habits and lifestyle.DesignEighty-two healthy overweight and obese subjects with habitual low intake of fruit and vegetables and sedentary lifestyle participated in  a parallel 8 week-randomized controlled trial. Forty-three participants received a MD, tailored to their habitual energy intakes, and 39 maintained their habitual diets. Blood, urine and faecal samples along with dietary information and anthropometric measures were collected over the study period to monitor dietary changes, several metabolic parameters and the gut microbiome.ResultsMD subjects significantly increased their adherence to MD. Daily intakes of vegetal food products, providing dietary fiber, vegetable proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, dramatically increased while foods of animal origin were reduced. Adherence was confirmed by diet-driven metabolome shifts including reductions of plasma and urinary levels of carnitine, and led to reduction of total plasma cholesterol, total and secondary faecal bile acids. Gut microbiome also changed, for which variations of gene richness and inflammation were found anticorrelated and for which levels of fibre degrading Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increased, escorted by microbial functions linked to butyrate metabolism. Moreover, consistent links were highlighted among urolithin production, bile acids degradation and insulin sensitivity with specific microbial species and dietary patterns.ConclusionMD drives multiple shifts in gut microbiome and metabolome independently from energy intake.",Mediterranean diet intervention in overweight and obese subjects leads to multiple beneficial shifts in gut microbiome and metabolome independently from energy intake,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP116295&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR3857002-ERR3857994,ERA2037587,"ERS4277259-ERS4277410,ERS4277412-ERS4277421,ERS4277423-ERS4277451,ERS4277453-ERS4277505",ERX3869075-ERX3870067,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP116295&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2019-07-13,5121712784,777860142326,2020-02-17

SRP006764,SRP006764,NA,DIPP Diabetes Microbiome,"Recent studies have suggested a bacterial role in the development of autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Over 30 billion nucleotide bases of Illumina shotgun metagenomic data were analyzed from stool samples collected from four pairs of matched T1D case-control subjects collected at the time of the development of T1D associated autoimmunity (i.e., autoantibodies). From these, approximately one million open reading frames were predicted and compared to the SEED protein database. Of the 3,849 functions identified in these samples, 144 and 797 were statistically more prevalent in cases and controls, respectively. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, adhesions, motility, phages, prophages, sulfur metabolism, and stress responses were more abundant in cases while genes with roles in DNA and protein metabolism, aerobic respiration, and amino acid synthesis were more common in controls. These data suggest that increased adhesion and flagella synthesis in autoimmune subjects may be involved in triggering a T1D associated autoimmune response. Extensive differences in metabolic potential indicate that autoimmune subjects have a functionally aberrant microbiome. Mining 16S rRNA data from these datasets showed a higher proportion of butyrate-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria in controls compared to cases, while those bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids other than butyrate were higher in cases. Thus, a key rate-limiting step in butyrate synthesis is more abundant in controls. These data suggest that a consortium of lactate- and butyrate-producing bacteria in a healthy gut induce a sufficient amount of mucin synthesis to maintain gut integrity. In contrast, non-butyrate-producing lactate-utilizing bacteria prevent optimal mucin synthesis, as identified in autoimmune subjects.",,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP006764&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","SRR203317-SRR203318,SRR203320-SRR203323,SRR203325-SRR203326",SRA036573,SRS192951-SRS192958,SRX062297-SRX062304,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP006764&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2015-06-22,150430300,30086060000,2011-11-07

Many gut microbes have previously been associated with CD, but these have mainly been confounded with patients’ ongoing treatments. Additionally, most analyses of CD patients’ microbiomes have focused on microbes in stool samples, which yield different insights than profiling biopsy samples. We sequenced the 16S rRNA gene (16S) and carried out shotgun metagenomics (MGS) from the intestinal biopsies of 20 treatment-naïve CD and 20 control pediatric patients. We identified the abundances of microbial taxa and inferred functional categories within each dataset. We also identified known human genetic variants from the MGS data. We then used a machine learning approach to determine the classification accuracy when these datasets, collapsed to different hierarchical groupings, were used independently to classify patients by disease state and by CD patients’ response to treatment. We found that only 16S-identified microbes could classify patients by disease state, but that both sequencing technologies could classify patients by treatment response. Based on follow-ups with these patients we identified which microbes were best for predicting disease state and response to treatment, including several previously identified markers. By combining the top features from all significant models into a single model, we could compare the relative importance of these predictive features. We validated these top features with an independent cohort to demonstrate that they are general predictors of CD state. We demonstrate for the first time that useful predictors of CD treatment response can be produced from shotgun MGS sequencing of biopsy samples despite the complications related to large proportions of host DNA. The top predictive features that we identified in this study could be useful for building an improved classifier for CD and treatment response based on sufferers’ microbiome in the future.","16S and MGS data treatment naive, pediatric CD microbiome","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP024243&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","ERR2042042-ERR2042081,ERR2045085-ERR2045159",ERA979957,ERS1833521-ERS1833560,"ERX2101099-ERX2101138,ERX2104142-ERX2104216","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP024243&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2017-12-04,4403749574,881056230895,2017-07-26

ERP017091,ERP017091,PRJEB15371,The gut microbiome in Crohn's disease and modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition,"AbstractBackgroundInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with Crohn’s disease (CD) being one of the primary types, have been extensively studied for genetic and gut microbial factors leading to its epidemic in the modern world. However, limited information using metagenomic shotgun-sequencing to pinpoint the gut microbial species and functions involved. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a nutritional therapy used for disease-modifying treatment of CD, but its impact on the gut microbiome remains unclear. ResultsWe collected 123 stool samples from 49 CD patients, 14 of whom were resampled after 2 weeks of EEN, and 56 subjects with no disease. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing and analyses confirmed a decreased diversity in the gut microbiota of CD patients, and identified microbial species and potential functions altered in CD, most notably an increased ratio of hexa- to penta-acylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Some co-abundance gene groups (CAGs) including Parabacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides intestinalis, Ruminococcus sp. showed strong correlation with clinical indicators such as hs.CRP, Prealbumin, platelets and BMI. The entire cohort could be divided into three types according to their species composition, with Type A largely consisting of healthy controls and Type C containing exclusively CD or after EEN samples. Although compositional changes were generally mild after 2 weeks of EEN, remodeling of the gut microbial network could be observed.ConclusionsOur metagenomic dataset unlock the gut microbiome in CD for functional investigations. Microbiome-based stratification of CD patients before EEN might help optimize the therapy for wider applications.",123CD-metagenomics,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP017091&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR1620255-ERR1620377,ERA701286,ERS1343317-ERS1343439,ERX1690620-ERX1690742,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP017091&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2016-09-12,3377652382,663826771532,2016-11-11
ERP105801,ERP105801,PRJEB24006,"Neonatal gut-microbiome-derived 12,13 DiHOME impedes tolerance and predicts childhood atopy and asthma","Neonates at heightened risk of childhood atopy and asthma are characterized by inter-kingdom perturbation of their gut microbiota and metabolic dysfunction that includes fecal enrichment of the linoleic acid metabolite, 12,13 DiHOME1. Treatment of human dendritic cells (DCs) with this oxylipin decreased IL-10, altered expression of peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-γ (PPARγ)-regulated genes, and decreased regulatory T cell (Tregs) frequency ex vivo. Mice treated with 12,13 DiHOME and subjected to a model of airway allergic sensitization had exacerbated pulmonary inflammation and decreased lung Tregs.

ERP013933,ERP013933,PRJEB12449,"Reproducibility of associations between the human gut microbiome and colorectal cancer assessed in a patient population from Washington, DC, USA","Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota affects colorectal cancer development, but previous studies have varied in population, technical methods, and associations with cancer. Understanding these variations is needed for comparisons and for potential pooling across studies. Therefore, we performed whole-genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing on fecal samples from 52 pre-treatment colorectal cancer cases and 52 matched controls from Washington, DC. We compared findings from a previous 16S rRNA study to the metagenomics-derived taxonomy within the same population. In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. Considering significant cancer associations with the relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in the French population, statistically significant associations in the Washington, DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, and seven out of 17 pathways. In conclusion, metagenomic sequencing results reproduced most, but not all of the major taxonomic associations with colorectal cancer previously observed from 16S rRNA profiles. In addition, colorectal cancer in the Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways identified from the French study. More within and between population comparisons are needed to identify sources of variation and disease associations that can be reproduced despite these variations. Future studies must have larger sample sizes or pool data across studies to have sufficient power to detect associations that are reproducible and significant after correction for multiple testing.",Colorectal cancer and the human gut microbiome,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP013933&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR1293056-ERR1293937,ERA556170,ERS1066634-ERS1066743,ERX1364628-ERX1365509,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP013933&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2016-01-20,3868574676,621391292660,2016-02-02

This can lead to increased susceptibility to certain types of infection, as well as contribute to increase risk of antimicrobial resistance. When given with IV ß-lactam antibiotics, Ribaximase degrades excess antibiotics excreted into the upper GI tract before they can disrupt the gut microbiome and alter the resistome.During a Phase 2b clinical study, Ribaxamase treatment led to significant reduction in Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving ceftriaxone. Longitudinal fecal samples (349) were collected from the patients, and the metagenomic content of these samples was sequenced.The results of this study found a significant increase in ß-lactamase (CfxA) and vancomycin resistance genes (vanD) in placebo-treated vs. ribaxamase-treated patients. We also identified significant correlations between changes in the gut resistome and clinical study parameters including ß-lactamase gene frequency and study drug assignment, and efflux pump gene frequency and vancomycin resistance.

ERP009422,ERP009422,PRJEB8347,Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,"Background: Metagenomics has become a prominent approach for exploring the role of the gut microbiota in human health. However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.

Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.

Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",Time Series,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP009422&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","ERR747972-ERR748293,ERR748295-ERR748505,ERR748509-ERR748541",ERA407337,ERS652523-ERS652592,"ERX691654-ERX691975,ERX691977-ERX692187,ERX692191-ERX692223","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP009422&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2015-03-16,2615928873,418865263002,2015-03-16

We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort.

ERP022986,ERP022986,PRJEB20800,Gut resistome modulates resilience and recovery of gut microbiota after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment,"Antibiotics have profound impacts on the microbial communities living in the human gut, where bacterial species harbor and exchange antibiotic resistance genes collectively called resistome. Human population surveys have demonstrated that gut microbial resistomes reflect local antibiotics usage patterns, while previous small cohort studies based on single antibiotic exposures have shown varying degrees of antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota and their associated resistome. However, the role of resistomes of particular gut species in their ability to persist in the face of antibiotic treatment has not been systematically studied.Applying shotgun sequencing and quantitative metagenomics, we analyzed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of gut microbiota in 12 healthy young men over a 6 month period following a 4-day intervention with three broad-spectrum antibiotics. The gut microbial communities of the study subjects underwent profound compositional changes due to the treatment but slowly recovered to near-baseline compositions. Immediately after the treatment, the gut microbiota featured an increased relative abundance of opportunistic and proinflammatory bacterial species, and a decreased relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers, while exhibiting an increased functional potential for multidrug efflux pumps and virulence factors. These enrichment trends were weaker after 8 days and mostly cleared out after 42 days. However, 9 common intestinal commensal species found at baseline and associated with short chain fatty production or efficient digestion of polysaccharides remained undetectable in most of the subjects even after 180 days.Carrying genes that confer resistance to the antibiotics used in this multidrug study had specific consequences for the survival and de novo colonization potential of microbial species. While species harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were positively selected during and after the intervention, those harboring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance exhibited increased odds of de novo colonization but decreased odds of survival. Despite a mild long-lasting imprint following exposure to three antibiotics, the gut microbiota of healthy young adults are resilient to a broad-spectrum antibiotic intervention, and their recovery process is modulated by antibiotic resistance gene carriage.",Antibiotic,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP022986&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","ERR1995211-ERR1995267,ERR1995271-ERR1995327",ERA914962,ERS1726291-ERS1726347,"ERX2055080-ERX2055136,ERX2055140-ERX2055196","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP022986&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2017-05-11,2060807255,379744698566,2018-05-24

ERP110976,ERP110976,PRJEB28730,Metagenomic stool samples in time series,"OBJECTIVE:
The composition of the healthy human adult gut microbiome is relatively stable over prolonged periods, and representatives of the most highly abundant and prevalent species have been cultured and described. However, microbial abundances can change on perturbations, such as antibiotics intake, enabling the identification and characterisation of otherwise low abundant species.

DESIGN:
Analysing gut microbial time-series data, we used shotgun metagenomics to create strain level taxonomic and functional profiles. Community dynamics were modelled postintervention with a focus on conditionally rare taxa and previously unknown bacteria.

RESULTS:
In response to a commonly prescribed cephalosporin (ceftriaxone), we observe a strong compositional shift in one subject, in which a previously unknown species, U Borkfalki ceftriaxensis, was identified, blooming to 92% relative abundance. The genome assembly reveals that this species (1) belongs to a so far undescribed order of Firmicutes, (2) is ubiquitously present at low abundances in at least one third of adults, (3) is opportunistically growing, being ecologically similar to typical probiotic species and (4) is stably associated to healthy hosts as determined by single nucleotide variation analysis. It was the first coloniser after the antibiotic intervention that led to a long-lasting microbial community shift and likely permanent loss of nine commensals.

CONCLUSION:
The bloom of U B. ceftriaxensis and a subsequent one of Parabacteroides distasonis demonstrate the existence of monodominance community states in the gut. Our study points to an undiscovered wealth of low abundant but common taxa in the human gut and calls for more highly resolved longitudinal studies, in particular on ecosystem perturbations.",NA,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP110976&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",ERR2906808-ERR2906836,ERA1609671,ERS2906140-ERS2906156,ERX2909968-ERX2909996,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP110976&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2019-03-14,514856084,141393575344,2019-03-14

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by chronic inflammation and multi-organ damage, has been suggested to associate with gut dysbiosis, but knowledge is limited from small sample size and 16s rRNA-based studies. To shed new light on the role of microbiota in SLE development, we analyzed the fecal metagenome of 117 treatment-naïve SLE patients and 115 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC) by deep-sequencing; in addition, 52 of the aforementioned patients have post-treatment fecal metagenome for comparison. We found significant difference in microbial composition and function between SLE and HC, revealing multiple plausible contributing bacterial species and metabolic pathways in SLE. In-depth SNP-based analysis revealed an oral-microbiome origin for two marker species, strengthening the importance of bacterial translocation in disease development. Lastly, we confirmed experimentally that peptides of SLE-enriched species mimicking autoantigens such as Sm can trigger autoimmune T-cell responses, suggesting a potentially causal role of gut microbiota in SLE.",NA,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP192580&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes",SRR8898458-SRR8898741,SRA874085,SRS4624488-SRS4624771,SRX5684579-SRX5684862,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP192580&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2020-04-26,11257212065,3371993458800,2020-04-26

The pathophysiology is far from settled, and components of micro-inflammation, neuro-immunological signaling and gut microbial dysbiosis are frequently emphasized as causative factors. Here, we present fecal metagenomic sequencing data from our earlier published randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for IBS – the REFIT trial. Only samples from participants who received active fecal microbiota transplants were included in the present data set; 14 participants with effect of FMT (Effect) and 8 without (No effect) were chosen. Samples were collected at baseline before FMT, after 6 and 12 months. Also samples from the transplants (Donor) given to the participants were analyzed. In total 66 recipient samples and 17 donor samples were subjected to deep metagenomic sequencing (Illumina NextSeq550), generating on average 27.3 *106 reads. After in silico quality control, assembly and annotation, we generated taxonomic and functional profiles. Alpha diversity measures showed a significantly increased diversity and evenness in the IBS groups compared to the donors (P=0.0026 and 0.0046 for Effect and No effect groups by Simpson index, respectively). Taxonomic profiles showed higher relative abundance of phylum Firmicutes, and lower relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, compared to donors at baseline. This profile was shifted towards the donor profile following FMT, and we derived, from the Effect group, a list of 170 species, differentially abundant, that were most prominent in this shift. Analysis of imputed growth rates showed that the resulting growth pattern was a conglomerate of donor and recipient activity. Thirty-four functional subclasses showed distinct differences between baseline samples and donors, most of which were shifted towards a donor-like profile after FMT. Functional systems involved in short chain fatty acid synthesis were detected, and also an increase in systems synthesizing growth factors like Menaquinone and scavenging metal ions like Zink and Manganese. We conclude that FMT induces long-term changes in gut microbiota, and these changes mirror the clinical effect of the treatment.",REFIT,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP119291&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","ERR4367751,ERR4368182,ERR4368197,ERR4368451,ERR4368456,ERR4368466,ERR4368493,ERR4368582,ERR4368772,ERR4369372,ERR4369536,ERR4369542,ERR4369548,ERR4369556,ERR4369565,ERR4369658,ERR4369672,ERR4369705,ERR4369816,ERR4369821,ERR4369828,ERR4369866,ERR4369926,ERR4370050,ERR4370935,ERR4370945,ERR4370970,ERR4370982,ERR4370994,ERR4371004,ERR4371024,ERR4371112,ERR4371333,ERR4371825,ERR4371997,ERR4372004,ERR4372195-ERR4372197,ERR4372199,ERR4372227,ERR4372547,ERR4372556,ERR4372672,ERR4372675,ERR4372677,ERR4372685,ERR4373217,ERR4373560,ERR4373976-ERR4373978,ERR4383745,ERR4383747-ERR4383751,ERR4383831-ERR4383833,ERR4384072,ERR4453698,ERR4454094,ERR4455859,ERR4456075,ERR4463069,ERR4463146,ERR4463148,ERR4463151-ERR4463152,ERR4463157-ERR4463158,ERR4463180-ERR4463181,ERR4463208,ERR4463261,ERR4463434,ERR4463529,ERR4465694,ERR4465696,ERR4465728-ERR4465729,ERR4466898,ERR4467142,ERR4467209,ERR4467245,ERR4467303,ERR4467688-ERR4467690,ERR4467733,ERR4467748",ERA2339876,"ERS4842935-ERS4842944,ERS4842946-ERS4843028","ERX4311890,ERX4312321,ERX4312336,ERX4312590,ERX4312685,ERX4312695,ERX4312722,ERX4312787,ERX4312977,ERX4313558,ERX4313722,ERX4313728,ERX4313734,ERX4313742,ERX4313751,ERX4313844,ERX4313858,ERX4313891,ERX4314002,ERX4314007,ERX4314014,ERX4314052,ERX4314112,ERX4314236,ERX4314927,ERX4314937,ERX4314962,ERX4314974,ERX4314986,ERX4314996,ERX4315016,ERX4315104,ERX4315325,ERX4315817,ERX4315989,ERX4315996,ERX4316187-ERX4316189,ERX4316191,ERX4316219,ERX4316539,ERX4316548,ERX4316664,ERX4316667,ERX4316669,ERX4316677,ERX4317209,ERX4317552,ERX4317968-ERX4317970,ERX4327563,ERX4327565-ERX4327569,ERX4327644-ERX4327646,ERX4327885,ERX4394069,ERX4394465,ERX4396230,ERX4396446,ERX4403440,ERX4403517,ERX4403519,ERX4403522-ERX4403523,ERX4403528-ERX4403529,ERX4403551-ERX4403552,ERX4403579,ERX4403632,ERX4403805,ERX4403900,ERX4404552,ERX4404554,ERX4404586-ERX4404587,ERX4405756,ERX4406015,ERX4406082,ERX4406118,ERX4406176,ERX4406557-ERX4406559,ERX4406602,ERX4406617","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=ERP119291&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2020-01-10,2648987231,734602010965,2020-03-09

Yet we know little about microbial communities in hospitals, or about the extent to which persistent vs. recently immigrated bacterial strains establish in the gastrointestinal tracts of hospitalized individuals.In combination with BioProject PRJNA273761 (10 infants / 55 samples) we analyzed strain-resolved genomes obtained from a total of 202 samples collected over a three-year period from 21 infants hospitalized in the same intensive care unit.Strains were rarely shared, consistent with prior analysis of a subset of these data. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, common gut colonists, exhibit diversity comparable to that of NCBI reference strains, suggesting no recent common ancestor for all populations in this hospital setting. Thus, we infer multiple introduction events for these species. Despite the rarity of shared strains, strains of five species exhibiting a degree of sequence variation consistent with in situ diversification were identified in different infants hospitalized three years apart. Three were also detected in multiple infants in the same year, suggesting that these strains are unusually widely dispersed and persistent in the hospital environment. Persistent strains were not significantly different from non-persistent strains with regards to pathogenicity potential including antibiotic resistance. Notably, non-identical siblings had multiple abundant strains in common, even 30 days after birth and antibiotic administration, suggesting overlapping strain sources and/or genetic selection. Our approach can be used in order to study microbial dynamics in hospitals and provides an important step towards directing health-promoting colonization in hospitalized individuals.",human gut metagenome,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP074153&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,fastq_ftp,fastq_md5,fastq_bytes","SRR3466404,SRR3498907,SRR3498909,SRR3506419-SRR3506420,SRR3546776,SRR3546778-SRR3546782,SRR6257372-SRR6257518",SRA421268,"SRS1417035,SRS1433906-SRS1433907,SRS1433910,SRS1437768,SRS1446905,SRS1446907-SRS1446911","SRX1736260,SRX1757398-SRX1757399,SRX1757406,SRX1762376,SRX1775699,SRX1775701-SRX1775705,SRX3363826-SRX3363972","https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=SRP074153&result=read_run&fields=run_accession,submitted_ftp,submitted_md5,submitted_bytes,submitted_format",2016-06-29,4755637345,914759429095,2016-06-29
