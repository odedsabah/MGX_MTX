          <STUDY_TITLE>Identifying frailty-associated markers in Elderly Irish Individuals</STUDY_TITLE>
          <STUDY_ABSTRACT>In this study, we first show that disease-microbiome associations display specific age-centric trends. Ageing-associated microbiome alterations towards a disease-like configuration occur in colorectal cancer patients, thereby masking disease signatures. We identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the ELDERMET cohort. The relevant taxa differentially encode specific functions that are known to have disease associations. The shotgun sequence data for the ELDERMET cohort is deposited here.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
