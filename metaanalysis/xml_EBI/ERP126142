          <STUDY_TITLE>Differences in Fecal Microbiomes and Metabolomes of People With vs Without Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Bile Acid Malabsorption</STUDY_TITLE>
          <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous disorder, but diagnoses and determination of subtypes are made based on symptoms. We profiled the fecal microbiomes of patients with and without IBS to identify biomarkers of this disorder. We collected fecal and urine samples from 80 patients with IBS (Rome IV criteria; 16-70 years old) and 65 matched individuals without IBS (control individuals), along with anthropometric, medical, and dietary information. Shotgun and 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing were performed on feces.Patients with IBS had significant differences in network connections between diet and fecal microbiomes compared with control individuals; these were accompanied by differences in fecal metabolomes. We did not find significant differences in fecal microbiota composition among patients with different IBS symptom subtypes. Despite the heterogeneity of IBS, patients have significant differences in urine and fecal metabolomes and fecal microbiome vs control individuals, independent of symptom-based subtypes of IBS.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
